<b> About the Data </b><br>
Bluebikes is Metro Boston's public bike share program, with more than 1,800 bikes at over 200 stations across Greater Boston. 
The team was interested in the flow of bikes, or "pulse" of the city, and used the December 2019 data published by Bluebikes.

<b> Design Decisions </b><br>
The team was fundamentally interested in the Bluebikes Data, which reports bikeshare trips around Boston, and see if a <i>pulse</i> can be noticed via visualisation. 
We then decided on our final product to be an interactive map-based tool that allows users to click on different variables to explore.

<b> Rationale for Design Decisions </b><br>
How did you choose your particular visual encodings, interaction, and animation techniques? 
What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?
An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. 

<b> Commentary on the development process </b><br>



<b> Some interesting things to explore with our visualisation  </b><br>
<li> How does the commuting direction change over the course of a day? </li>
<li> What time do people leave class or work? </li>
<li> Do rush hour trips really take longer? </li>
<li> Where do students go at 3am? </li>

<b> Using our visualisation </b><br>
Pan and zoom around the map to explore. Bike stations are represented with bubbles. Click on a station to view all the traffic originating or terminating at the selected station, and its relationship with other stations. Drag the slider on the top right to move across different times of day (or use the play button to advance automatically). Finally, use the visualization options on the right for more advanced customizations.

<b> Data Source </b><br>
Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
Remember to acknowledge all appropriate sources not just in your write-up but also directly on your visualization itself 
(including the source of your data, and any example visualization you drew inspiration from).
