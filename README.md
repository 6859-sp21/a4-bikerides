<b> Design Decisions </b>
The team was fundamentally interested in the Bluebikes Data, which reports bikeshare trips around Boston, and see if a <i>pulse</i> can be noticed via visualisation. 


A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings, interaction, and animation techniques? 
What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?
An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. 
Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
Remember to acknowledge all appropriate sources not just in your write-up but also directly on your visualization itself 
(including the source of your data, and any example visualization you drew inspiration from).
